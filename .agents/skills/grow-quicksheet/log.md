  - Add subpages: /features, /extensions (long-tail keyword targets)
  - Create OG image for social sharing
  - Verify Lighthouse score and fix any issues
- **Bucket E (features — high variety value after website run):**
  - Theme presets (dark/light/solarized/nord) — visually impressive, screenshot-worthy
  - Status bar improvements (filename, cell count, mode indicator)
- **Bucket F (extensions — separate repos):**
  - `quicksheet-sysmon` — CPU/RAM/disk in cells (great screenshots)
- **Bucket A (polish):**
  - Rename screenshot files to meaningful names, update README refs
